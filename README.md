Fungus Manager
==============
This is a character and scene manager system that simplifies the creation of multi-scene Fungus stories and games.

The SceneManager manages the opening and closing of sub-scenes, making possible the use of a central flowchart for scene switching. The SceneManager also adds Fungus events and commands to simplify multi-scene management.

The CharacterManager manages the creation of Fungus characters and allows for character-specific 3D SayDialogs and MenuDialogs.

The Hyperzoom system is an experimental interface for zomming into and out of objects in Managed scenes. It depends heavily on the SceneManager.
